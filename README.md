# TMDAD_Proyecto_septiembre

The objective of this project is to build a messaging application using the Java Spring tool. There are identification systems, chat room reaction systems and obviously functions for sending messages to defined recipients. And finally, a superuser that can send advertising or announcement messages to all users.
